Turtle crossing game in Turtle Graphics. The game gets progressively more difficult each time you achieve a higher level. The scoreboard updates by one each time the turtle reaches Y 280. The turtle gets sent back to the starting position when reaching the top. Game also ends if colliding with a car (rectangle).
